# HexCoord

Hexagon-based tile map coord system, C# implementation of [this superb guide to hexagon maps](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons).

Currently in development, for some mobile games prototyping.


Three coord structures implemented `AxialCoord`, `CubeCoord`, `OffsetCoord`.

Task list:
- [x] Three coord systems
- [x] Conversion between systems
- [x] Cross-system equality-check
- [ ] TileMap container implementations
- [ ] Geometry-based tile picking
- [ ] Basic pathfinding


Feel free to use, share, modify this code.
